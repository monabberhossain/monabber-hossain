                        I am Monabber Hossain. I am a full-stack JavaScript web
                        developer. I am not very experienced in this field but
                        am a skilled developer. Already I have done 15+ projects
                        with different technologies like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
                        Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Firebase,
                        MongoDB etc.

                        I studied BSc. in Computer Science at the University of
                        Development Alternative. At university, I was very good
                        at programming languages like C, Java, and PHP. After
                        completing my BSc program, I started an IT Training
                        Centre in Sherpur. But I had a lot of interest in
                        programming, so I returned to programming even though it
                        was late. For this reason I focus on web development.
                        Recently I completed a course on Web Development with
                        JavaScript from Programming Hero.
